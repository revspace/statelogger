This executable will create /var/statelog if it doesn't exist, or expand it to
contain the state for the current minute.

When run several times in the same minute, the state is overwritten with the
current value.

A "minute" is defined as a 60-second period since the start_time as defined in
the header of the file, and will probably not be aligned with the MM in
HH:MM:SS.
